# Mission2
Project-2_NLP_CLU
# Introduction
In this Mission 2, we will go through the process of creating a new project CLU (Conversational language Understanding). CLU is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft that enables you to add natural language understanding to applications. With CLU, we can create custom machine learning models that can recognize and interpret user input, making it easier to build intelligent applications.

# Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure we have the following:

A Microsoft Azure account with access to the CLU service.
A basic understanding of natural language processing and machine learning concepts.
# Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Log in to the CLU portal.
Go to the CLU portal.
Log in using your Microsoft Azure account credentials.
Step 2: Create a new project.
Click on the "Create New" button on the top right corner of the page.
Enter a name for a project.
Select the language of for project.
Select the type of  project.
Click on the "Create" button.
Step 3: Define entities.
Click on the "Entities" option on the left-hand side menu.
Click on the "Add Entity" button.
Enter the name of entity.
Select the type of entity.
Click on the "Create" button.
Repeat steps 2-5 for all the entities want to define.
Step 4: Define intents.
Click on the "Intents" option on the left-hand side menu.
Click on the "Add Intent" button.
Enter the name of intent.
Click on the "Create" button.
Repeat steps 2-4 for all the intents want to define.
Step 5: Define at least 15 utterances for each intent.
Step 5: Train a model
Step 6: Deploy a model.
Step 7: Test a model.

# Conclusion:
Congratulations! We successfully created a new project in CLU and trained a custom machine learning model. We can now use this model to add natural language understanding to our applications
